## What Does [nyae] mean?
$ dir
zsh: correct 'dir' to 'gdir' [nyae]?
n: no – don’t correct; run dir, as you typed
y: yes – do correct; run gdir, as Zsh suggested
a: abort – don’t run anything, and get a new prompt (to type a completely different command)
e: edit – edit what you typed interactively – for instance, so you can change dir to udir
